## Transaction
For bitcoin's data structure, unlike traditoinal app's back-end database, the only thing recorded in bitcoin's block chain is transaction. There is nohing like a table holding records of public keys and corresponding balance like table shown below:

| Public Keys   | Balance       | Other |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| PK1           | 10 BTC        | ..... |
| PK2           | 11 BTC        | ..... |
| PK3           | 0.2 BTC       | ..... |


For most developers, this table strucure is most familiar one. Unfortunately, the way data saved in bitcoin is not like this, not even close. A very special data structure applied in block chian technology: all data is saved in only one big long block chain and the chain comprises of blocks where multiple transaction saved. Sounds not very straightforward? Please see image below to see an example:

There are mainly 2 parts in a block: header and transactions. In a block, all transactions are encoded and saved in a merkle tree, and header only records the tree's root node. Except for the root, the header also has information including nonce, target, previous block, etc. I am going to talk about them later in the article.  

Transactions in a block record all detailed information and a sample transaction looks like the img below:

In a transaction, there are mainly 2 parts: input and output. Outputs have values that can be spent and public keys indicating who can spend the value; input has a reference to previous unspent transaction output and signature information to show the ownership of a previous unspent output. Any output wihout input referred is called unspent transaction output (UTXO).  

In a transaction, the sum of values in output must be less than input and transaction fee is calculated as (total values in input) - (total values in output). Miner node of the block calculates transaction and creates an output for himself with value of transaction fee. Another important thing is that UTXO cannot be partly used, which means if you want to use the UTXO, you must spend all value in the UTXO. As you can see, value of a UTXO is fixed and cannot be modified, so if an input unblock the UTXO, the input will get all value. For example, assuming Alice has 2 UTXO with value 1 BTC and 2 BTC, if Alice wants to send Bob 1.5 BTC, she needs to do: create 2 inputs refering 2 outputs respectively and one output to Bob with value 1.5 BTC and another output to herself with value 0.499 BTC(let's say transaction fee is 0.01 BTC in this case). In the senario, if Alice forget to create output to send change to herself, 0.5 BTC will be considered as transaction fee. Details of transactions are shown below:  

| Input   | value       | output | value |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-------:|
| input of UTXO 1  | 1        | output to Bob |1.5|
| input of UTXO 2  | 2        | output to Alice |0.499|



After above explaination, it is should be clear how to calculate balance of an account: node needs to scan the whole UTXOs to sum all values of the UTXO for the account.  

## Locking & unlocking script
#### P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash)
In this part, I am going to talk about how to lock a value in output and unlock it input. First take a closer look at inputs and ouptuts in code level:
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [
    {
      "txid": "7957a35fe64f80d234d76d83a2a8f1a0d8149a41d81de548f0a65a8a999f6f18",
      "vout": 0,
      "scriptSig" : "3045022100884d142d86652a3f47ba4746ec719bbfbd040a570b1deccbb6498c75c4ae24cb02204b9f039ff08df09cbe9f6addac960298cad530a863ea8f53982c09db8f6e3813[ALL] 0484ecc0d46f1918b30928fa0e4ed99f16a0fb4fde0735e7ade8416ab9fe423cc5412336376789d172787ec3457eee41c04f4938de5cc17b4a10fa336a8d752adf",
      "sequence": 4294967295
    }
  ],
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.01500000,
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
    },
    {
      "value": 0.08450000,
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 7f9b1a7fb68d60c536c2fd8aeaa53a8f3cc025a8 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",
    }
  ]
}
```
In the input `vin`, the attribute scriptSig is locking script. Locking script is called scriptSig because it always contains a signature. In the output `vout`, the attibution scriptPubkey is unlocking script. Unlocking script is called scriptPubKey because it always contains a public key.  

Bitcoin script is a stack-based language. Unlokcing and locking scripts will be pushed to a stack and then get executed by bitcoin virtual machine. See example below:  
locking script:
```
"OP_DUP OP_HASH160 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
```

unlocking script:
```
3045022100884d142d86652a3f47ba4746ec719bbfbd040a570b1deccbb6498c75c4ae24cb02204b9f039ff08df09cbe9f6addac960298cad530a863ea8f53982c09db8f6e3813[ALL] 0484ecc0d46f1918b30928fa0e4ed99f16a0fb4fde0735e7ade8416ab9fe423cc5412336376789d172787ec3457eee41c04f4938de5cc17b4a10fa336a8d752adf
```
When it boils down, the formats for locking and unlocking scripts are like:  

Locking script: `"OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"`  
Unlocking script: `"{Signature} {PublicKey}"`  

In execution, the sequence is: {Signature} {PublicKey} OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG.  

| Stack   | script       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| empty  | {Signature} {PublicKey} OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG |
| {Signature} {PublicKey} | OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|
| {Signature} {PublicKey} {PublicKey} | OP_HASH160 {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|
| {Signature} {PublicKey} {PubKeyHash} | {PubKeyHash} OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|
| {Signature} {PublicKey} {PubKeyHash} {PubKeyHash} | OP_EQAULVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG|
| {Signature} {PublicKey} | OP_CHECKSIG|
| true or false | empty|

In this case, the stuff used to lock output is specifc account's public key, and it is called P2PKH which means the output is paid to account whose hased public key is saved in locking script.  

#### P2SH
P2PKH is a good way locking and unlocking output for simple use, while it is some times hard for a complex logic. Let's look at this scenario: if an output is paid to a group and and unlocking condition is at least M of N people in the group provide signature to unlock. The scenrio is called multi-signature.   
It can be done is P2PKH way, and it can be done is this way:  

locking script: `M <Public Key 1> <Public Key 2> ... <Public Key N> N CHECKMULTISIG`  
unlocking script: `<Signature B> <Signature C>`  
The script to be executed: `<Signature B> <Signature C> M <Public Key 1> <Public Key 2> ... <Public Key N> N CHECKMULTISIG` 
The validation is like last example, stack-based script is used to execute this script and return true of false based on signature.  

There are 2 problems for P2PKH in this case. First is that payer needs to create a long script to lock the UTXO, and longer UTXO will increase transaction fee for payer. The second is payer has to understand logics for payee and also know how to create output based on the logics. In order to overcome these 2 problem, P2SH is introduced here.  In the same scenario, if the payee create the logics, hash it and send the hasded logics to the payer, payer only needs to write this hashed value with other OP_CODE into locking script. Detail is like below:  

locking script: `HASH160 54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e EQUAL`  
unlocking script: `<Sig1> <Sig2> <2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG>`  
Validation: `<Sig1> <Sig2> <2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG> HASH160 54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e EQUAL`  

In this scenario, first is to use Hash160 to hash the script `<Sig1> <Sig2> <2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG>` and then compare the hashed and existed value. If they are same, validate by the logics script provided by unlocking script. If validated though this way, payer just needs a hash provided by payee and don't have to know the logics and create locking script by himself and also don't need to pay more transaction fee for more bytes in locking script.  

Importantly, although example provided here is a multi-signarure scenario, the P2SH can be used for more complex logics:   
example:   
If output is within 30 days  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require 2 of 3 signatures plus lawyer's signature  
If output is within 60 days  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require 1 of 3 signature plus lawyer's signature  
If output is more than 90 days  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require only lawyer's signature  
  
```
01  IF
02    IF
03      2
04    ELSE
05      <30 days> CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
06      <Lawyer's Pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY
07      1
08    ENDIF
09    <Pubkey 1> <Pubkey 2> <Pubkey 3> 3 CHECKMULTISIG
10  ELSE
11    <90 days> CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
12    <Lawyer's Pubkey> CHECKSIG
13  ENDIF
```
This logics created by payee can be hashed into a has value and sent to payer, and the payer only need to write this in output.  

## Summary
In block chain the all data is saved in blocks. There are mainly 2 ways for locking & unlocking.
